    "#### Brief\n",
    "Initially, I had intended on pursuing shipping companies and their reliability concerning time delta between estimated and actual delivery, as well as that of their countries of origin. With that, I encountered two issues: using the carrier_code alone would limit the required tables to be used, and that there seemed to be many cases of carrier_codes being linked to multiple countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "That proved to be troublesome in more ways than one. I had hoped to be able to separate out ships or voyages into their own SQL tables, but continued to encounter issues of non-unique data -- voyages including multiple estimated times due to multiple shipments onboard, companies running under up to 5 different countries, ships belonging to multiple carrier companies, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "So I went back and switched the main question to pertain to the shippers. This allowed for more static information by country and, based on quick pandas explorations, showed enough repeat shippers to make meaningful insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "From there, I narrowed down my pertinent fields, leaving some extraneous fields that may, as I explore and transform the data, have the potential to prove useful. From header, the most important fields concerned dates, the carrier code, and the identifier to connect with the consignee and shipper. From shipper and consignee, I pulled the identifier, name, and associated address information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving forward, the most challenging aspect of the cleaning process will definitely concern the address, as the input data is far from uniform.\n",
