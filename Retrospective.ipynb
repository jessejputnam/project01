However, I think that the current level of denormalization on the gold layer still lends itself well to the star model. I think, for better hierarchical structure as a galaxy model, it may be beneficial to separate out country from sub-region from region. But I am not sure. I feel I would benefit from more modeling of this concept and model to see how it is used in real world scenarios and why one would implement star vs galaxy vs normalized tables, and especially delineating between them.\n","\n","I am not 100% behind this idea as being a good choice for the data, but a part of me is curious as to whether it would be a good idea to, in the shipment table, include the calculation already completed for estimated to actual arrival time delta."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# If you were given 2 more weeks on this, how would your approach have changed"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["That is difficult to answer, mostly because many of the ways I would approach it differently are because of things I did not know before hand, and only discovered after the fact, once I had practical experience in exploring.

In addition to the obvious errors (see above), there were dates that *could* make sense, but my knowledge of these shipping manifests makes it difficult to know that for certain. If an arrival delta is -40 (arriving 40 days before expected arrival), is that in error? Does that mean that the shipping occurred far in advance of anticipation? I don't know. In my report, I made a cut off of 60 days in either direction (ahead or behind), but that was, for all intents an purposes, an arbitrary decision made out of ignorance.
